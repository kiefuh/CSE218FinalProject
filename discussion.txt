From looking at the graphs and comparing the two different implementations I would say that overall single loop and
triple loop are the same with a big O of n. The reason I say the big O is n is because both of their graphs 
are linear. Another reason I say that they are both n is because even though the triple loop has three loops they 
are not nested within each other, and since each loop only does one thing once they have a big O of 1. The large loop
around the three of them is n so it is n*(1+1+1) which is still n in terms of big O. Since the big O is n, when the 
word count increases the performance should decrease. So at the beginning of the graph it should have low times and at
the end the time taken should be greater.
